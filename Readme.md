#### This dataset is published by the article **"RP-NW: An effective Alignment method based on relative pitch for sight-singing"**

#### This dataset includes 127 sight-singing songs' note alignment annotations that can be used to evaluation note alignment algorithms.  In addition, there are also a corresponding music recording and a file of onset annotation and pitch that can be used for note transcription  in each folder.

#### `*_onset.txt` contains the onset annotations. The first column is onset given in seconds, the second column is pitch.

#### `*_label.txt` contains the note alignment annotations. The first two columns are the same as in `*_onset.txt`, the third column is the indexes of score note, the fourth column is score notes.

#### `*.mp3` is the sight-singing recording from different singers. All of the data come from the WeChat   Mini Program *Sight-singing Talent*. If you want to test your sight-singing ability, hurry up and use WeChat to scan the QR code as below!
